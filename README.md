# **OG-Project**

Open Genome Project. Open-source genome database for XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) Models. 

1. Aims to map out areas of interest (patterns) in various AI models that contribute to the 
    - Skill 
    - Behaviour 
    - Decision making process

    of models. 

1. Help researchers, ML engineers & decision makers
    - Better understand AI
    - Better regulate AI development
    - Create safer AI
    - Create more useful AI
    - Create "humanity aligned" AI
