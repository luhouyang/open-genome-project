# **Supervised Learning**

Supervised machine learning is a fundamental approach for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It involves training a model using labeled data, where each input comes with a corresponding correct output. The process is like a teacher guiding a student—hence the term “supervised” learning. - [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/supervised-machine-learning/)
